# Mineflayer Dashboard
Mineflayer Dashboard is a controllable, HTML coded Dashboard that can connect to your Mineflayer bot's server using it's IP and port.
It was being worked on for a bit, but we discontinued it to work on bigger and better projects.
We still might update it once in a while, and may continue the project in the future.

There is no license connected to this so you can add/remove things for your own bot!
